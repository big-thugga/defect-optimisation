# Cost-constrained multi-depot vehicle routing model
A cost-constrained multi-depot vehicle routing model used to optimise work packaging. Makes three decisions simultaneously of what jobs to do, who does them, and how to do them. This therefore maximises workforce utility and productivity. 

## Model features
- Maximise the job score (Score function, balanced by travel time and job time)
- Crew constraints
- Due dates
- Different start and end depots
- Different start and end shift times

## Data input
The data used to create and test the model is from NEMA. 
- 5 depots (Wangaratta, Shepparton, Wodonga, Seymour, Mansfield)
